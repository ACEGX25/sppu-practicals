1) Create a database of SEIT class (at least 8 records). Database contains diffrent fields of every student like Roll No. ,Name an SGPA(array of structure).
  a) Arrange roll call list of students according to roll numbers in ascending     	order using Bubble Sort.
   b) Search Student according to SGPA.

2) Create a database of SEIT class (at least 8 records). Database contains diffrent fields of every student like Roll No. ,Name an SGPA(array of structure).
  a) Arrange list of students alphabetically using Insertion Sort.
   b) Search Student name using Binary search.

3) Implement Stack as an ADT using singly linked list. Use this ADT for conversion of infix to postfix expression .

4) Implement Stack as an ADT using singly linked list. Use this ADT for conversion of infix to prefix expression .

5) Implement Circular Queue using Array. Perform following operations on it:
  a) Insertion  b) Deletion  c) Display d) Check Queue Full Condition

6) Construct an Expression Tree from postfix expression. Perform recursive in-order , preorder and postorder traversals.

7) Construct an Expression Tree from postfix expression. Perform non-recursive in-order , preorder and postorder traversals.

8) Implement Binary Search Tree and perform following operations :
   a) Insert  b) Display tree (Traversal) c) Display Height of the Tree d) Search

9) Implement Binary Search Tree and perform following operations :
   a) Insert  b) Delete c) Display Level wise  d) Mirror Image

10) Implement Binary Search Tree and perform following operations:
  a) Insert  b) Display tree (Traversal c) Mirror Image

11) Implement in-order Threaded Binary Tree and traverse it in in-order.

12) Implement in-order Threaded Binary Tree and traverse it in  pre-order.

13) Represent a graph of your college campus using adjacency matrix. Nodes should represent the various departments and links should represent the distance between them .

Find Minimum spanning Tree using Kruskal’s algorithm

14) Represent a graph of your college campus using adjacency matrix. Nodes should represent the various departments and links should represent the distance between them .

Find Minimum spanning Tree using Prim’s algorithm

15) Represent a graph of city using adjacency matrix. Nodes should represent the various landmarks  and links should represent the distance between them .

Find the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm from single sourse to all destinations.

16) Implement Heap Sort to sort given set of values using max heap.

17) Implement Heap Sort to sort given set of values using min heap.

18) Department maintain student’s database. The file contains roll no, nuame ,division and address. Write a program to create a sequential file to store and maintain studnt data. It should allow the user to add and delete information of student.

19) Department maintain student’s database. The file contains roll no, nuame ,division and address. Write a program to create a sequential file to store and maintain studnt data. It should allow the user to add information of student. Display information of particular student. If record of student doesnot exist an aprropriat message is displayed. If record is found it should display the student details.
